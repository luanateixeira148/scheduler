# Interview Scheduler
Scheduler is a application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. It was created during my time at Lighthouse Labs, to practice building a full-stack application using React. 

The Scheduler client application was created using Create React App. The Scheduler API server uses Express. Tests were conducted using Jest and Cypress.
